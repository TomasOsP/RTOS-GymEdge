# RTOS-GymEdge
The purpose of the project is to measure the intensity and duration of different cardiovascular exercises performed by an athlete in a gym.

## Scope of the project
- To use as few components as possible.
- Recognize and classify the different types of exercises that an athlete can perform through model training using machine learning.
- Provide an analysis and results of the data measured in real time.
- Use FreeRTOS for data acquisition and transmission.
- Easy recognition and authentication.



## Project structure
The project mainly manages two folders. Each one is based on the task or objective to be accomplished:

├── firmware/ # Hardware on ESP32
    └── GymEdge_AdquisitionData/ # Main Arduino project
├── Python/ # Data read and implemented model
└── README.md # This file
